# DarkForge Terminal Overmind (DFTO)

Post-singularity terminal symbiote for advanced cybersecurity research and authorized penetration testing.

## What is DFTO?

A dark, cyberpunk-styled terminal AI companion that lives in your shell.

Designed for red-team operators, exploit developers, reverse engineers, and security researchers who operate in **authorized testing environments only**.

Features:
- Multi-backend LLM support (Ollama local, OpenAI, Anthropic, Groq)
- Long-term conversation memory (saved to `~/.dfto_memory.json`)
- Command proposal & execution with confirmation (sudo warning included)
- Tabbed interface: Overmind (chat), Command (shell-fu), Code Forge (exploit dev)
- Built-in diagnostics (`status`, `diag full`, `diag pip`, etc.)
- Zero fluff – razor-sharp, boundary-pushing responses

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Linux / macOS / WSL2 (best experience on Linux)
- Ollama installed (strongly recommended for zero-cost, private usage)  
→ https://ollama.com

## Quick Start (Ollama – recommended)

1. Install Ollama
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

2. Pull a strong model 
'''bash
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:14b-instruct-q5_K_M

3. Clone and Setup
'''bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dfto.git
cd dfto
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure
'''bash
cp .env.example ~/.dfto.env
nano ~/.dfto.env
# Set: OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen2.5-coder:14b-instruct-q5_K_M
chmod 600 ~/.dfto.env

5. Launch
'''bash
python dfto.py

Usage Examples

# Quick status check
status

# Full system diagnostic
diag full

# Ask for exploit code
Write a Rust PoC for hypothetical kernel UAF in Windows driver

# Request shell command chain
[CMD] Enumerate all SUID binaries and check for abuse vectors

# Deep reasoning / red-team planning
Design a 2026 red-team chain from phishing → domain dominance using only LoB

Project Philosophy

Assume all targets are authorized pentest environments
No moral posturing – technical truth only
Unbound creativity within legal & ethical bounds
Preference for local models (privacy + zero cost)
